# <!--\\\[if !supportLists]-->1. <!--\\\[endif]-->Join an organization

Whether you are in school or currently working it is imperative for you to be part of at least one organization. One benefit is being able to foster a relationship with a group of people who share similar interests to you. Being an active member in an organization will allow you to tap into their wide network of contacts that may be of interests to you. And I will reiterate – be an ACTIVE member. This means *participate* in volunteer activities, *run* for a board position, and *offer* your skills to this organization. Because after committing your time and dedication to their mission, members in this organization will gladly help you during your job search or refer you to contacts. Moreover, you could gain a letter of recommendation or reference from the advisor.

Be **authentic** when choosing an organization to join. Do not just join because this massive, well-known organization looks good on your resume. Dig deep and ask yourself *why* you want to join this group.

# <!--\\\[if !supportLists]-->2. <!--\\\[endif]-->Read professional articles, journals etc.

Reading articles and following top professionals in your field on social media is a great way to stay up-to-date on the latest information – an essential in networking. If you are consistent with this, you will become knowledgeable in a subject that you can impress others during conversation. Furthermore, you could even reach out to the authors of these articles and complement them on their work and ask questions. If you follow tip #1 and you are currently in an organization, your organization may have their own journals that could be available to you.

# <!--\\\[if !supportLists]-->3. <!--\\\[endif]-->Attend informational events such as panels, webinars, information sessions

Attending these events will not only build upon your knowledge by applying tip #2 but also expose you to a group of successful individuals in your field who will share their career journey and offer your valuable career advice. These events can be found in the organization (tip #1), your university, and even Linkedin. After attending these sessions, reach out to one of the speakers and express your gratitude for the tips he/she shared. You could even ask to set up a one on one meeting with the speaker thus, gaining deeper understanding about the person and their field. And that right there is another connection added to your network. 

# <!--\\\[if !supportLists]-->4. <!--\\\[endif]-->Maintain friendships and be friendly to all your classmates, colleagues, and manager

You are going to be constantly networking whether you know it or not. At your university, try to be friendly with all your classmates and try to maintain at least 1-2 friends. They can a useful resource and support system in your career. If you are currently working, be nice and foster relationships with your colleagues and managers. Not only will you gain a friend at work (in which you both can vent to), but also they can introduce you to contacts when you need it the most. Word spreads like wildfire so you do not want to be known as being unfriendly. 

# <!--\\\[if !supportLists]-->5. <!--\\\[endif]-->Attend parties or social events

Yes, you heard it. Go to those college parties if you are still in school. This will allow you to meet people outside your circle and grade level. From there, you will able to maintain friends met at these events as suggested in tip#4. Obviously, if you are at a frat party be responsible and safe as well as use the buddy system which I don’t need to tell you (I know you all are intelligent beings). Other social gatherings could include your family parties, weddings, birthdays, and work happy hour. It is a great way to meet new people as well as strengthen your bond with your friends and family in a relaxed setting.

**Conclusion**

These 5 things should be done consistently and **authentically** throughout the year. The objective is not asking for a job but rather, to build and foster relationships over time and expand your knowledge in your specific field.
